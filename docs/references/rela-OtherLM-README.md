# rēlā - Other Launch Monitor Connector API

This repository documents and demonstrates the external `Other` launch monitor connector API for `rēlā`.

It documents the contract already implemented in the application and ships a minimal template plugin project so contributors can create and publish connector DLLs.

## What the repo is for

- Provide a stable source-of-truth for the `Other` plugin surface.
- Show how `rēlā` discovers and runs third-party launch monitor connectors.
- Offer a minimal starter plugin so people can begin integration without needing to reverse engineer the host project.

## Current architecture in `rēlā`

`rēlā` already loads external plugins from the application directory using type discovery:

1. User selects `Other` in settings (which is intentionally routed through the same external backend).
2. `PluginFinder` scans each local `.dll`, loads assemblies, and registers all public non-abstract types implementing `ILMDevice`.
3. For `Other`, `PluginFinder` picks the first registered `ILMDevice` that is not clearly a built-in family.
4. `DeviceSessionCoordinator` calls:
   - `Init()` when the device instance is selected.
   - `Discover()` when the user clicks Discover/Search.
   - `Connect()` when a direct connect is requested.
5. The UI consumes shot and state events and passes shot data into telemetry and simulator transport.

The Search action does **not** call `Connect()` after `Discover()` returns. If a connector expects Search to produce a live session, its `Discover()` implementation must continue through connection itself (commonly `return Connect();`) or start the complete asynchronous discover/connect workflow before returning.

## Contract to implement

Connector implementations must implement `ILMDevice` from the `rela.OtherDevice.Abstractions` NuGet package. The package contains compile-time metadata only; rēlā supplies the matching runtime assembly from its embedded application bundle.

## Interface surface

`ILMDevice` requires:

- Events:
  - `Action<DeviceShotData> OnBallData`
  - `Action<DeviceShotData> OnShot`
  - `Action<DeviceShotData> OnShotEnded`
  - `Action<DeviceRawShot> OnRawShot`
  - `Action<string> OnNotification`
  - `Action<string> OnHandedChange`
  - `Action<string> OnModeChange`
  - `Action<string> OnError`
  - `Action<string> OnNote`
- Methods:
  - `bool SetRightHanded()`
  - `bool SetLeftHanded()`
  - `bool Connect()`
  - `bool Reconnect()`
  - `bool Disconnect()`
  - `bool SetPuttingMode()`
  - `bool SetChippingMode()`
  - `bool SetNormalMode()`
  - `void Init()`
  - `string GetDeviceName()`
  - `bool Discover()`
  - `bool ResetReady()`

For `Other`, the app looks for these optional properties by reflection and falls back to defaults when absent:

- `bool OtherIsReady`
- `bool OtherBallPresent`
- `bool OtherIsArmed`
- `bool SessionConnected`
- `bool UsesTelemetryFinalShotPath`
- `long LastStatusUtcTicks`
- `string SupportedConnectionTypes`

These are not part of `ILMDevice` today, but `rēlā` reads them as extension points. Set them as soon as state is known:

- `OtherIsReady` controls the ready indicator.
- `OtherBallPresent` controls the ball detected indicator and readiness gating behavior.
- `OtherIsArmed` distinguishes an armed session from a ball-ready state.
- `SessionConnected` lets the host detect a transport that ended without relying only on text notifications.
- `UsesTelemetryFinalShotPath` should be `true` only when the connector emits one authoritative final measurement through `OnShotEnded` in every mode. This prevents the legacy non-normal-mode pipeline from expecting a separate `OnBallData` packet for putting or chipping. When the property is absent or `false`, the existing mode-dependent event behavior is unchanged.
- `LastStatusUtcTicks` participates in the generic 25-second activity watchdog. Only expose it if the connector refreshes it on transport activity; keepalive intervals must remain below that timeout.
- `SupportedConnectionTypes` is a comma-separated capability list such as `Network`, `USB,Network`, or `Bluetooth`.

The host also recognizes optional public methods by reflection:

- `bool ArmOnly()` for the Arm UI and AXIS force-arm command.
- `bool SetClub(string club)` for simulator club synchronization.

These extension members are backward compatible because they are discovered by name at runtime rather than added to `ILMDevice`. Existing connectors that do not expose them retain the previous defaults.

### Connection and state notification contract

Connection transitions are currently recognized from exact generic prefixes:

- Successful connection: `[Other] Connected: ...`
- Disconnection or failed search: `[Other] Disconnected: ...`
- Immediate ready/ball refresh: `[Other] BallStatus: ready=true ball=false`

Connector-specific informational prefixes are fine for ordinary notes, but they do not replace these generic lifecycle messages. Emit the connected notification only after the transport handshake is complete.

### Optional device settings

Connectors that expose their own settings UI can additionally implement `IDeviceSettingsProvider`:

```csharp
public interface IDeviceSettingsProvider
{
    void ShowDeviceSettings();
}
```

When `Other` is selected and the active connector implements this interface, rēlā shows a **Device Settings** button in the Settings window. Clicking it calls `ShowDeviceSettings()` on the active connector.

The connector owns the complete settings experience: UI, validation, persistence, and applying changes to a live device. The host does not inspect or render connector setting fields. `ShowDeviceSettings()` must marshal to the appropriate UI thread when needed and should report failures through the normal plugin events rather than throwing into the host.

The example connector implements this complete path. Its plugin-owned dialog edits handedness and mode, persists them to `Settings/Other/example-other-connector.json`, and publishes `OnHandedChange` and `OnModeChange` after a successful save. See `ExampleOtherLmConnectorDevice.ShowDeviceSettings()` and `ExampleOtherLmConnectorSettingsDialog`.

The example also demonstrates the final-only event model: it exposes `UsesTelemetryFinalShotPath = true` and emits each completed measurement once through `OnShotEnded`.

## Shot calls and payload expectations

`rēlā` consumes `DeviceShotData` and optionally `DeviceRawShot`.

`rēlā` receives shot information through callback-style events; there are four calls that matter to plugin authors.

1. `OnBallData(DeviceShotData shot)`
   - Use this for **in-flight** telemetry and pre-impact updates.
   - `rēlā` treats these as `ShotPhase.BallData` and may use them for streaming telemetry/ready-state logic.
   - This can be called 0..N times per shot window.

2. `OnShot(DeviceShotData shot)`
   - This event is part of the API surface for compatibility with older integrations.
   - In current `rēlā` flow it is not wired to transport, so emit it only if you need a dedicated separator event for tooling.
   - The preferred final-shot path for `rēlā` is `OnShotEnded`.

3. `OnShotEnded(DeviceShotData shot)`
   - This is the primary final-shot event for `rēlā`.
   - When emitted, `rēlā` marks the payload as `ShotPhase.ShotEnded` and routes it through normal shot dispatch.
   - Emit this once per shot once all metrics are ready and values are final.

4. `OnRawShot(DeviceRawShot rawShot)`
   - Optional telemetry path for raw payload logging.
   - `rēlā` only persists/logs this when raw-shot logging is enabled in settings.

Per-shot payload guidance:
- Set `IsShotValid` accurately. Invalid shots are still accepted for telemetry, but dispatch behavior can be filtered by plugin/device policy.
- Fill core ball metrics when available: `Speed`, `HLA`, `VLA`, `BackSpin`, `SideSpin`, `SpinAxis`, `TotalSpin`, and `CarryDistance`.
- Keep `Speed`/spin/angles in the same unit system you intend to model consistently; `rēlā` applies the same interpretation consistently across plugins.
- Optional `Notes` entries are accepted and can be used for diagnostics.
- Include optional club metrics (`ClubSpeed`, angles, impact fields, confidence fields) when available so downstream inference/quality logic can use them.

## Template project

A starter plugin with the full event/method surface is under:

- `src/ExampleOtherLmConnector/ExampleOtherLmConnectorDevice.cs`
- `src/ExampleOtherLmConnector/ExampleOtherLmConnectorSettings.cs`
- `src/ExampleOtherLmConnector/ExampleOtherLmConnectorSettingsDialog.cs`
- `src/ExampleOtherLmConnector/ExampleOtherLmConnector.csproj`

### Build

Restore and build the example normally. The API contract is restored from NuGet.org:

```bash
dotnet build src/ExampleOtherLmConnector/ExampleOtherLmConnector.csproj
```

## Deploy

1. Build the connector assembly.
2. Copy only the connector DLL next to `rela.exe`. Do not deploy files from `rela.OtherDevice.Abstractions`; rēlā supplies that contract at runtime.
3. Open `rēlā` and set Device Type to `Other`.
4. Click Search. The connector's `Discover()` implementation must perform or start the full discover/connect workflow.
5. Use logs to confirm `OnNotification` messages and status updates.

## Repository conventions

- Keep dependencies small.
- Keep plugin state and networking inside the plugin assembly.
- Emit status strings on `OnNotification` and non-fatal detail on `OnError`.
- Use `Other` + optional state properties above for richer UI behavior.
- Prefer stable device names in `GetDeviceName()` so users can identify the plugin quickly.

## Recommended minimum behavior

- Implement `Discover()` and `Connect()` idempotently.
- Make `Discover()` establish or start the live session because Search does not automatically call `Connect()` afterward.
- Return `true` once your plugin has started or scheduled async startup work.
- Set `SessionConnected`/`OtherIsArmed` when the transport is live, and set `OtherIsReady` according to the device's actual ready-to-hit state.
- Clear ready/ball state on `Disconnect()` and `Reconnect()`.
- Use the generic `[Other] Connected:`, `[Other] Disconnected:`, and `[Other] BallStatus:` lifecycle prefixes.
- Emit `OnModeChange(...)` and `OnHandedChange(...)` whenever mode/handedness changes so `rēlā` UI stays in sync.
- For a final-only connector, expose `UsesTelemetryFinalShotPath = true` and emit each measurement once through `OnShotEnded`; do not duplicate the same payload through `OnBallData`, which is reserved for optional in-flight updates.
- If the device itself identifies a final measurement as a putt, include the note `OTHER_PUTT_LIKE=1`. This preserves true-putt handling even if simulator club selection has not yet changed to `PT`.
- Avoid throwing out of interface methods; return `false` on failure.

## Open-source onboarding checklist

- [ ] Create a repo with this folder as the root.
- [ ] Add your connector in `src/YourConnectorName/`.
- [ ] Reference a `rela.OtherDevice.Abstractions` package version supported by the target rēlā release.
- [ ] Add a connector-specific README and license.
- [ ] Tag a release with a DLL artifact for users.
